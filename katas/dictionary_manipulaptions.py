# Count Word Frequencies
# Task: Given a list of words, build a dictionary mapping each word to its count.
# Example: ["apple", "banana", "apple"] -> {"apple": 2, "banana": 1}.

# Group Anagrams
# Task: Given a list of words, group them together if they are anagrams of each other.
# Example: ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"] -> [["eat","tea","ate"], ["tan","nat"], ["bat"]].

# Invert a Dictionary
# Task: Swap the keys and values in a dictionary (handle collisions/duplicate values carefully).
# Example: {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3} -> {1: "a", 2: "b", 3: "c"}.

# Find the First Duplicate Character
# Task: Given a string, find the first character that appears more than once using a dictionary to track counts.
# Example: "abca" -> 'a' (first repeated character).

# Intersection of Two Dictionaries
# Task: Find keys that appear in both dictionaries and their values (if they match or not).
# Example: {"a":1,"b":2,"c":3} and {"b":2,"c":4,"d":5} -> Intersection is {"b":2} (if we only care about matching key-value pairs).
