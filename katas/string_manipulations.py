    pass

# 2. Check Palindrome
# Description
# Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome (a string that reads the same forward and backward).

# Input: "level" -> Output: True
# Input: "hello" -> Output: False

def check_palindrome():
    pass

# 3. Count Vowels and Consonants
# Description
# Given a string, count how many vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and how many consonants it contains. (Assume inputs consist of letters only for simplicity, or handle punctuation/spaces by ignoring them.)

# Example:

# Input: "Apprentice" -> Vowels: 4, Consonants: 6

def count_vowels_and_consonants():
    pass

# 4. Character Frequency
# Description
# Given a string, return a dictionary (or any data structure you prefer) where each key is a character from the string, and the value is the number of times it appears.

# Example:

# Input: "banana" -> {'b': 1, 'a': 3, 'n': 2}

def character_frequency():
    pass

# 5. Remove Duplicate Characters
# Description
# Write a function that removes any duplicate characters in a given string, keeping only the first occurrence of each character.

# Example:

# Input: "banana" -> "ban"
# Input: "abcaabcd" -> "abcd"

def remove_duplicate_characters():
    pass

# 6. Find the Longest Word in a Sentence
# Description
# Given a sentence, return the longest word (ignoring punctuation). If there are ties, return any one of the longest words.

# Example:

# Input: "This is a test sentence." -> "sentence"

def find_longest_word_in_sentence():
    pass

# 7. Reverse Each Word in a Sentence
# Description
# Given a sentence, reverse each word in place and return the resulting sentence.

# Example:

# Input: "Hello world"
# Output: "olleH dlrow"

def reverse_each_word_in_sentence():
    pass

# 8. String Compression
# Description
# Implement a basic string compression function. For each group of consecutive repeating characters, output <char><number_of_repeats>. If the “compressed” version isn’t shorter, return the original string.

# Example:

# Input: "aaabbc" -> "a3b2c1"
# If the compressed string has the same length or is longer, just return the original.

def string_compression():
    pass

# 9. First Non-Repeating Character
# Description
# Given a string, find the first character that does not repeat anywhere in the string. If every character repeats, return a special value (e.g., None).

# Example:

# Input: "swiss" -> 'w' (because 's' repeats, 'w' does not repeat)
# Input: "aabb" -> None (no unique character)

def first_non_repeating_character():
    pass

# 10. Generate All Substrings
# Description
# Given a string s, generate all possible substrings of s.

# Example:

# Input: "abc"
# Substrings: "a", "b", "c", "ab", "bc", "abc"

def generate_all_substrings():
    pass


# 11. Validate an Anagram
# Description
# Given two strings, determine if they are anagrams of each other (i.e., if they contain the same letters in the same quantity).

# Example:

# Input: ("listen", "silent") -> True
# Input: ("hello", "olleh") -> True
# Input: ("abc", "abd") -> False

def validate_anagram():
    pass


# 12. Convert String to Title Case
# Description
# Given a string, convert it to “title case” format, where the first letter of each word is capitalized, and the rest are lowercase.

# Example:

# Input: "hello WORLD" -> Output: "Hello World"

def convert_string_to_title_case():
    pass

# 13. Remove All Occurrences of a Character
# Description
# Given a string and a character, remove all occurrences of that character from the string.

# Example:

# Input: "banana", "a" -> Output: "bnn"

def remove_all_occurrences_of_a_character():
    pass

# 14. Mask/Obfuscate Part of a String
# Description
# Given a string (e.g., a credit card number or email), replace certain parts of the string with a masking character, for privacy. The rules can vary (for instance, show only the first 2 and last 2 characters, and mask everything in between).

# Example:

# Input: "1234567890" -> Output: "12******90"
# Input: "abcdefg" -> Output: "ab***fg"

def mask_obfuscate_part_of_a_string():
    pass

# 15. Check if a String Contains All Letters of the Alphabet
# Description
# Determine if the given string is a “pangram”: it contains all 26 letters of the English alphabet at least once.

# Example:

# Input: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" -> True
# Input: "Hello world" -> False

def check_if_string_contains_all_letters_of_the_alphabet():
    pass

# 16. Caesar Cipher Encryption
# Description
# Implement the Caesar cipher, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a certain number of positions in the alphabet. Non-alphabetical characters are left as-is.

# Example:

# Input: "abc", shift = 2 -> Output: "cde"
# Input: "xyz", shift = 3 -> Output: "abc"

def caesar_cipher_encryption():
    pass

# 17. Find the Longest Common Prefix
# Description
# Given a list of strings, find the longest common prefix. If there isn’t one, return an empty string.

# Example:

# Input: ["flower", "flow", "flight"] -> Output: "fl"
# Input: ["dog", "racecar", "car"] -> Output: "" (empty string)

def find_the_longest_common_prefix():
    pass

# 18. Remove All Non-Alphanumeric Characters
# Description
# Given a string, remove all characters that are not letters or digits (for instance, punctuation, symbols, etc.).

# Example:

# Input: "Hello, World!" -> Output: "HelloWorld"

def remove_all_non_alphanumeric_characters():
    pass

# 19. Find and Replace Pattern in a String
# Description
# Given a string, find a specific pattern (sub-string) and replace it with another string.

# Example:

# Input: string="cats like to chase mice", pattern="cats", replacement="dogs"
# Output: "dogs like to chase mice"

def find_and_replace_pattern_in_a_string():
    pass

# 20. Sort Characters in a String
# Description
# Given a string, return a new string with its characters sorted in ascending alphabetical order.

# Example:

# Input: "cba" -> Output: "abc"
# Input: "banana" -> Output: "aaabnn"


def sort_characters_in_a_string():
    pass
