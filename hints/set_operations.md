## 1. Intersection, Union, and Difference
1. Python sets have built-in methods:
   - `intersection` (or the `&` operator)
   - `union` (or the `|` operator)
   - `difference` (or the `-` operator)
2. Compute each operation separately and store the results in a **dictionary** as required.  
3. Watch for **edge cases**: if one of the sets is empty, confirm how that affects intersection, union, and difference.

## 2. Check Disjoint Sets
1. Two sets are **disjoint** if they **share no common elements**.  
2. You can use:
   - `A.isdisjoint(B)` which returns `True` if there are no common elements.
   - Or check if `A & B` (the intersection) is empty.
3. Decide which approach to use. Both are effectively O(n) on average, but `isdisjoint` is succinct.

## 3. Find Missing Numbers
1. You have a **range** (e.g., `1..10`) and a **list** of actual numbers. Convert the list to a **set** for fast lookup.  
2. You can build another **set** representing the full range (e.g., using `range(start, end+1)`).  
3. The set of **missing numbers** is simply the difference between the full range set and the set of actual numbers.
4. Handle edge cases where the list is empty or the range is very small or very large.
